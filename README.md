# 3D_Project
This project was developed as part of the Nanodegree program at Udacity for the AI for Healthcare program. The educational content is provided by Udacity.

The code and accompanying text, including the English translation, have been refined and improved with the assistance of ChatGPT to ensure they are professional, clean, and well-structured. This enhancement was made to better align with best practices and improve readability.

I will be sharing this work with Laila Bellous, my instructor in the Data Science Bootcamp at Gomycode, and Yannis Pandis, my current mentor at Pfizer in Data Science applications for healthcare. The purpose of sharing is to gather academic feedback and further enhance the quality of the work.
